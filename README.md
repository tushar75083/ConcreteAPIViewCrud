# Django REST Framework CRUD Project using Concrete View Classes
This project demonstrates a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using the Django REST framework. It utilizes concrete API view classes to implement RESTful API endpoints for managing resources. The primary goal is to showcase how Django REST framework's built-in view classes can be used effectively to build APIs with minimal code and maximum functionality.

## Concrete API View Classes
1. ListAPIView
2. CreateAPIView
3. RetrieveAPIView
4. UpdateAPIView
5. DestroyAPIView
6. ListCreateAPIView
7. RetrieveUpdateAPIView
8. RetrieveDestroyAPIView
9. RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView <br

 In This Project, I used <b> ListCreateAPIView </b> and <b> RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView </b> which performs all the crud operation like create,read,update and delete..<br>

## Features
1. Implements full CRUD operations using Django REST framework's built-in concrete API view classes.<br>
2. Uses generic views like ListCreateAPIView and RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView to simplify API development.<br>
3. Demonstrates the flexibility of combining multiple views for different use cases.<br>
4. Provides clear separation of concerns with dedicated views for each type of operation.<br>


## Advantages
<b> Code Reduction: </b> Using the concrete view classes reduces boilerplate code by providing default implementations for common tasks.<br>
<b> Consistent Design: </b> Ensures a uniform way to handle API requests and responses, improving the maintainability of the codebase.<br>
<b> Customizable: </b> Each view can be easily customized by overriding default methods or adding extra functionality.<br>
<b> Error Handling: </b> Built-in error handling and validation mechanisms reduce the need for manual error management.<br>
<b> Flexibility: </b> Allows for fine-grained control over each operation while still keeping the code concise.<br>


## ListCreateAPIView
Combines ListAPIView and CreateAPIView to provide both listing and creation functionality in a single view.<br>
Implements GET for listing and POST for creating resources.<br>
Reduces code repetition by combining two related functionalities in one view.<br>

## RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView
Combines RetrieveAPIView, UpdateAPIView, and DestroyAPIView to offer retrieving, updating, and deleting in one view.<br>
Supports GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods.<br>
Reduces the amount of code by consolidating three related functionalities in a single view class.<br>

## Combining Classes for Code Reduction
Using combined classes such as <b>ListCreateAPIView</b> and <b>RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView </b>allows for significant code reduction by avoiding the need to write separate views for each operation. Instead of creating distinct views for listing, creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting resources, the combined classes offer these functionalities in a consolidated manner:

<b>Simplified Routing:</b> Fewer view classes mean fewer URL patterns, making it easier to manage.<br>
<b>Reduced Boilerplate Code:</b> Less code to maintain while retaining all the essential CRUD functionalities.<br>
<b>Consistent API Design:</b> Offers a consistent interface for interacting with the API, following RESTful principles.<br>
